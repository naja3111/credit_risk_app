phData MLE-Challenge has given a dataset, pre-built model and other environemnt set up to run pre-built model.

### Tasks:
* Explore and run pre-built model with given data and deploy the model into a REST API that allows users to POST data and obtain predictions.
* Improve given model (I tried a different model) and deploy into a REST API where multiple users can use API resources without service interruption.
